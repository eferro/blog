I like to think that I can consider myself a professional software developer after 20 years or working on it. Since some years ago I feel very aligned with agile software development movement and lately with the [software craftmanship movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship). I started to be interested in agile in 2002-2003 and in the software craftsmanship in 2012.
Currently when I try to describe myself I use the words “**software craftsman**” as an equivalent to “**software developer, continuously trying to improve his skills and craft**”.

Let me explain what I mean by “software craftsman”:

*   I mean being professional as software developer

*   Trying not only to create working code, trying to **create simple, easy to maintain code**.
*   Trying not only to create the code that the business required, also trying to **help the business to growth** (with different solutions, even without using code). **Adding steadily value to the business**.

*   In order to be a good professional there is a **strong need to learn and improve our skills, tools and practices**. Or even look for new ones.
*   IMHO a good process for learning or improving ours skills is **participating in the community** of professional software developers. In this process **the mentor / apprentice format** works very well to improve our skills.

Why not using the “agile software developer” denomination?
In fact, for my, this definition can be a good option, but currently, the term agile is even more confuse that craftsmanship.

For me, at least in my experience, the development of applications and systems **has more in common with a craft than with an engineering**. Engineering is the application of mathematics, empirical evidence and scientific knowledge, so it is possible to plan, predict and control. **IMHO software development for non trivial systems requires sense and respond and other approaches can derive in a false sense of control**.

Some kind of software efforts are more adapted to a engineering approach (algorithms, compilers, software for science), but in my case, this is the exception, not the norm.

So, currently in [my linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/eferro) I indicate that I work as Software Craftsman… I also indicate that I work as a Shaman, but this is different history :-)
